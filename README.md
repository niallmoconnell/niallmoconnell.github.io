# Niall's Personal Website
#### Video Demo:  (https://youtu.be/UvScyWnQMbM)
#### Description:
My Project is a Personal Portfolio Website hosted on Github Pages: https://niallmoconnell.github.io/index.html

#### I have used several resources when building this namely:
Unsplash: Images from some amazingly talented photgraphers and illustrators
Bootstrap: for all the web design and structure, I have had to read quite a lot of documentation over the past few weeks.
EmailJS: email for client side only applications

#### Languages used were:
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript

I had originally planned to build a python dynamic web application, but due to restrictions on GitHub pages I decided to remove the dynamic aspect from my project and create a personal portfolio website that was static. While I was disappointed with this I was happy that I would be able to utilise a free hosting service like GitHub pages and that I can continually hone and modify this site as I progress further in my career and life.

#### It has 4 main elements:
#### Home Page
- For this I created a index.html page and placed it in the main folder.
- Includes a button to the contact Form.
- Includes static text on the home page that details exactly who I am and what I am about.
- "failte." in the top corner means "Welcome" in Gaeilge.

Once I had decided on the types of project that I wanted to build, I broke it down into smaller sections. Landing was the first thing that I tackled. I wanted it to be something that looked sleek and simple but also fell in nicely with the rest of my website. I used a standard example from bootstrap for the landing page and then customized it accordingly. I removed the footer and added my own which I utilised on all of my pages. I played around with the styles to get something that I really liked.

#### About Page
- For this I created a about.html page and placed it in the main folder.
- In this page I have tried to nicely render a series of articles written by me.
- These articles are content I have thought is important for the type of work I would like to do and what I am passionate about.
- It also includes a carousel at the top of the page.

I wanted to have a long page for my about page. I had always seen websites which scrolled down and more interesting content appeared. I needed a way to plan this out so that it didnâ€™t look like I was just adding sections for the sake of it. I utilised Figma for this and planned out my about and portfolio pages. I also researched on Awwwards to find inspiration and ideas which I could bring into my own project. With my About page, I included my carousel at the very top and then a 3 columned section for 3 different noteworthy articles. Below this section I just had static alternating images and text which highlighted a specific area about me.

#### Works Page / Portfolio Projects
- For this I created a works.html page and placed it in the main folder.
- This page will detail all of the projects that I have worked on.
- These projects will be easily scrolled through at a glance but users have the option to delve into more detail also.

The works page was a tricky one, arguably the most important on the website. I wanted something that gave visitors the ability to find out more while also enabling them to easily scroll through an array of projects. I decided to use a page wide jumbotron as a good way to nicely and dynamically display each one of these projects.

#### Contact Page
- For this I created a contact.html page and placed it in the main folder
- The contact page includes a standard contact me form which sends an email to my own personal email when the user submits. I have utilised Email JS for this. I needed something that could trigger an email on the client side and this provided a perfect solution.

On the contact page, I have 3 fields:
- Name
- Email
- Message

Underneath these fields I have the submit button which triggers the email and routes the user to the success.html page signifying that the email was sent.

I experimented with HTML and CSS to render this in the best way and found some inspiration from the internet for this.

I will continue to add projects and update this website as I complete more projects and hopefully move it from being hosted on GitHub pages to another source so that I can build it dynamically.
